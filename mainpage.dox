 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 * The Image Filtering Library provides a set of classes and functions for applying various 
 * image processing techniques to 2D images and 3D volumes. It includes support for common 
 * filters such as blurring, edge detection, sharpening, and projection operations.
 *
 * @section features_sec Features
 * - Apply different types of 2D filters (Blur, Edge Detection, Sharpening, etc.).
 * - Perform 3D volume filtering using Gaussian and Median blur.
 * - Extract 2D slices from 3D volumetric data.
 * - Perform intensity projections (max, min, mean, median) on 3D volumes.
 * - Convert images between different color spaces (RGB, HSV, HSL).
